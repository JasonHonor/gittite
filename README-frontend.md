When I started the project with tauri,
I planned to organize the UI only with HTML and javascript.
However, following the example, I was forced to encounter nodejs.
I startd to study nodejs frameworks i.e. react, vue, and svelte.

## Project setup

```
yarn create vite
yarn add -D @tauri-apps/cli
yarn tauri init
```

## yarn install on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g yarn
```

## UI with Vue and Quasar

From a beginner's point of view...

### svelte

It is simple and easy to learn, but there are not many pretty ui.
I tried sveltekit, sveltstrap, unocss, smui, carbon, daisyui, etc.
Daisyui is the most plausible, but there are also a lot of CSS attributes.

### react

At the first I reviewed react because it is popular.
But I give up studying as soon as I see the HTML code in javascript function.

### vuetify

Vue3 is not supported yet

## misc commands

```
yarn run eslint yourfile.js
```
